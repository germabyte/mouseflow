# Mouse Action Recorder and Replayer

## 1. Introduction and Purpose

### Introduction
This program allows users to **record their mouse clicks** and **play them back in an infinite loop**. It captures the mouse click positions and the mouse button used (left or right) during recording, and accurately replays the sequence.

### Purpose & Problem Statement
The code addresses the need for users who want to automate repetitive mouse clicking tasks, such as filling out forms, testing applications, or gaming actions without manual intervention.

### Value Proposition
Users can easily record their actions and automate mouse clicking without writing complex scripts or purchasing expensive automation software.
